- Custom chore doesn't need icon so remove pop up message asking for custom chore icon before saving
Comment: Need to Test 

- When chore icon is selected during chore creation, there shouldn't be a pop up asking for it everytime user views the chore

- There should be "See More" tab after the 6th chore in both assigned and finished chore" section. That "See More" tab will lead to a page where ALL chores within the last year can be viewed.

- add user icon on the upper right portion of the app to help improve user journey (show profile/default pic. Show all chores/rewards/claims). Rename "Dashboard" to "Family Dashboard"

- change time to 12 hour format in admin panel in chores page ------ DONE

- Swap positions of "Parental Approval" and "Mark as Completed" ------ APP SIDE

- check time differences in chores ----- DONE

- if child edits a chore created by parent, it should become black and need to re approval of parent 

- daily chore will be present in assigned chores till the final date(also need to show the final date on assigned chore), completion date will come in the finished chores once a parent or child completes a chore, for daily chore, it can be marked completed on daily basis & rows will be added into finished chore, if parent marks a daily chore as incomplete, that row will be deleted.
